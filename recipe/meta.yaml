  summary: interfaces with EMD 1.0 files
  description: |
    EMD (Electron Microscopy Dataset) 1.0 is an HDF5 based file format 
    which is designed to carry arbitrary data and metadata. emdfile is a
    Python package defining write and read functions and a set of classes 
    which together interface between EMD 1.0 files and Python runtime 
    objects. The classes are designed to quickly build, save to, and read 
    from filetree-like representations of data and metadata, and is built
    on HDF5+h5py.
